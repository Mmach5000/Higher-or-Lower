# Higher-or-Lower
A game where the computer selects a random number between 1 and 100 and you have to guess what the number is. If you guess wrong, the computer tells you whether the number is higher or lower than you guess.

Note: The Github version is the one that was made compleatly without AI. AI was used to make the program function in the browser.
